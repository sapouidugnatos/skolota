Further support for a North Caucasian origin of this cult (or at the very least evidence for its survival), may also be found in certain practices and beliefs in the Eastern Caucasus. First among them is the renowned craftsmanship of swords and other weapons from the Northern and Eastern Caucasus. Per Norris,

> *"A sword culture in the North Caucasus is a noteworthy feature to have been discovered in the recent archaeological excavations that have taken place at sites dating from between the 1st and 8th century AD including the period of the Arab invasion."*[^a]

In fact, the importance of metallurgy in the Caucasus is known from a very early date:

> *"The increase in metallurgical activity by ca. 3000 BCE is concomitant with an intensification of relations north to south between the Caucasus and the Near East. The diffusion of some specific objects (like the tripartite spearheads) from the Caucasus (Novosvobodnaja and the Kura–Araxes c) to Anatolia, northern Mesopotamia and as far away as Turkmenistan, confirms the importance of metallurgy in the Caucasus during this period."*[^i]

The dissemination of metallurgic technologies through the Eastern Caucasus to the Pontic-Caspian steppes beyond is also well-known,[^c] as well as the area's general mastery of metallurgic techniques from the Koban culture onwards, as noted by Jaimoukha:

> *"Metallurgy was at an advanced stage of development, with differentiated professionals organized at the clan level. "*[^d]

Even further, the influence of Caucasian metallurgy on the later Scythians and Sarmatians has received considerable attention.[^e] This exchange at the beginning of the interactions between the two groups is summarized well by Jaimoukha:

> *"Archaeological finds show that there was a healthy cultural exchange between the Sarmatians and the North Caucasians. Caucasian-made objects were found in abundance in Sarmatian burial grounds. The Nakh seem to have been on the whole more advanced in their material culture than the Iranians, who were, among other things, not familiar with foundry work and the potter’s wheel. On the other hand, the Sarmatians, with their tribal kings and aristocracy, had superior social organization and military know-how (Ya.Z. Akhmadov 2002)"*[^f]

This tradition of metallurgy was eventually inherited by the latest Iranian steppe tribes to inhabit the Northern Caucasus, the Alans:

> *"Many ancient Greek and Latin authors reported that among all the valiant peoples of the first centuries of CE, the Alans had the best military iron equipment. Tacitus wrote that the main power of the Alans was represented by their hard cavalry. It was recruited from the smart mobility. The Alanic rider wore the firm iron helmet and a coat of mail and used iron stirrups. His horse was also protected by an iron corslet. He was armed with the long spear tipped with an iron head and terribly long iron sword which could smash all the kinds of defense (Tacitus, Historiae, I, 79). Later, Arabic authors also described the wonderful Alanic sabers made of the highest quality steel."*[^g]

Metallurgy may have in fact been so important to the early Medieval Alans that some metallurgic themes have have almost certainly been preserved in the folklore of the Ossetians, a Caucasus people and partial-descendant of the Alans,[^h] although probably not with the same kind of intentionality that some scholars might argue for.

This point can be even further elucidated by Islamic descriptions of the peoples of the Eastern Caucasus. From Norris, quoting Abū Ḥāmid:

> *"Near to Derbend (Darbandā) is a lofty mountain at the foot of which there are two villages wherein reside a nation called the Zirī (yah) K(G)arān denoting the manufacturers of hauberks. They embrace in their craft all weapons of war, be they coats of chain mail, hauberks, helmets, swords, [spears], bows, daggers and other copper weapons of war. Their wives, their sons and their daughters and their slaves, both male and female, are engaged in these crafts and they do not till the land, nor do they tend gardens."*[^b]

Leaving the information in Russian means that these sources should be easier accessible to anyone who may wish to locate them.</span></em></p><p><span>Very little knowledge of the religious beliefs and practices of the Scythian peoples has come down to us, and that which has is often (probably unintentionally) distorted or obfuscated by the authors that recorded evidence of these beliefs and practices, most notably Herodotus. Of particular note is the only instance of Scythian ritual behavior that Herodotus records. Herodotus tells us: </span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>&quot;It is their practice to make images and altars and shrines for Ares, but for no other god... their sacrifices to Ares are of this sort. Every district in each of the governments has a structure sacred to Ares; namely, a pile of bundles of sticks three eighths of a mile wide and long, but of a lesser height, on the top of which there is a flattened four-sided surface; three of its sides are sheer, but the fourth can be ascended. Every year a hundred and fifty wagon-loads of sticks are heaped upon this; for the storms of winter always make it sink down. On this sacred pile an ancient scimitar of iron is set for each people: their image of Ares. They bring yearly sacrifice of sheep and goats and horses to this scimitar, offering to these symbols even more than they do to the other gods.&quot;</span></em><sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-1' name='ref-footnote-1'>1</a></sup><span> </span></p></blockquote><p><span>Unfortunately, &quot;Ares&quot; is one of three deities for which Herodotus does not list a Scythian name. However, this type of sword worship is also attested among the Sarmatians, Alans, Huns, and, most fortunately, the Xiongnu. Ch&#39;ü-Hsün, in analyzing Chinese literary references to probable sword worship originating in the Xiongnu cult of </span><em><span>Ching lu shen</span></em><span>, is able to conclude that </span><em><span>Ching lu</span></em><span> was used to refer to both the sword itself and the deity that it represents, and is probably a loan of the same Iranian word which appears in Greek as </span><em><span>ἀκινάκης</span></em><span> and subsequently in Latin as </span><em><span>acīnacēs</span></em><span>.</span><sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-2' name='ref-footnote-2'>2</a></sup><span> This may very well indicate that the inherited Iranian martial deity of the Scythians took on the form of the hypostasis of the Scythian sword itself. If the name of this sword can be posited as the name of the Scythian &quot;Ares&quot;, then morphology must be considered. The word has been tentatively reconstructed in Old Persian as the neuter h-stem </span><span>*</span><span>*</span><em><span>akīnakaʰ-</span></em><span>.</span><sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-3' name='ref-footnote-3'>3</a></sup><span> If this morphology were to be applied to the lexeme within a general Old Iranian framework, it would likely yield something to the tune of </span><span>*</span><span>*</span><em><span>akīnakah-</span></em><span>, a neuter h-stem when referring to the sword itself, which would become </span><span>*</span><span>*</span><em><span>Akīnakāh</span></em><span> in the nom.sing.masc. when referring to the deity.</span></p><p><span>Of course, there is no guarantee that the Xiongnu were Iranian-speaking at any level. However, the name for the distinctive Iranian-style sword for this period, which has attestations across the entire Eurasian steppe, may very well have been an areal culture word. This may find support in the apparent origin of the word (and very possibly its cult) from North Caucasian. According to Kullanda, whose etymology is shared by Bulatbiev:</span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>&quot;</span><strong><span>ἀκινάκης </span></strong><span>Περσικὸν ξίφος, &quot;Persian sword&quot;, after Herodotus (VII 54). The latter, however, also designates the Scythian swords (IV 62; 70). This word also existed in Sogdian (kyn&#39;k) (compare above). Non-original, since in Iranian </span><span>*</span><span>ki would give ci. In Greek it is recognized as a borrowing, usually Iranian (Frisk 1960-73, 1: 53; Chantraine 1999: 47) or pre-Greek substratum (Beekes 2009,1: 51); no etymology is proposed. Apparently, a borrowing from the Proto-Nakh </span><span>*</span><span>ɦāhḳ́i (&#39;iron&#39;; compare the Batsbi ʕajhḳǐ &#39;id&#39;; other Nakh forms, the Proto-Nakh reconstruction and the Proto-North Caucasian etymology see NCED: 851-852) + -in (adjective suffix) + neḳV (cf. Batsbi neḳ &#39;knife&#39;) &#39;iron knife&#39;. The compound </span><span>*</span><span>ɦāhḳ́i-in explains the longitude of the iota, which Latin prosody indicates in borrowing from the Greek as acīnacēs: in the ode of Horace (Hor. Od. 1,27,5) this word is in the last place in the first line of Alkeev&#39;s eleven-syllable verse, in which the third from the end the syllable can only be long (cf. Chantraine 1999: 47; Beekes 2009, I: 51).&quot;</span></em><sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-4' name='ref-footnote-4'>4</a></sup></p></blockquote><p><span>Further support for a North Caucasian origin of this cult (or at the very least evidence for its survival), may also be found in certain practices and beliefs in the Eastern Caucasus. First among them is the renowned craftsmanship of swords and other weapons from the Northern and Eastern Caucasus. Per Norris,</span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>&quot;A sword culture in the North Caucasus is a noteworthy feature to have been discovered in the recent archaeological excavations that have taken place at sites dating from between the 1st and 8th century AD including the period of the Arab invasion.&quot;</span></em><sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-5' name='ref-footnote-5'>5</a></sup></p></blockquote><p><span>In fact, the importance of metallurgy in the Caucasus is known from a very early date:</span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>&quot;The increase in metallurgical activity by ca. 3000 BCE is concomitant with an intensification of relations north to south between the Caucasus and the Near East. The diffusion of some specific objects (like the tripartite spearheads) from the Caucasus (Novosvobodnaja and the Kura–Araxes c) to Anatolia, northern Mesopotamia and as far away as Turkmenistan, confirms the importance of metallurgy in the Caucasus during this period.&quot;</span></em><sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-6' name='ref-footnote-6'>6</a></sup></p></blockquote><p><span>The dissemination of metallurgic technologies through the Eastern Caucasus to the Pontic-Caspian steppes beyond is also well-known,</span><sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-7' name='ref-footnote-7'>7</a></sup><span> as well as the area&#39;s general mastery of metallurgic techniques from the Koban culture onwards, as noted by Jaimoukha:</span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>&quot;Metallurgy was at an advanced stage of development, with differentiated professionals organized at the clan level.&quot;</span></em><sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-8' name='ref-footnote-8'>8</a></sup></p></blockquote><p><span>Even further, the influence of Caucasian metallurgy on the later Scythians and Sarmatians has received considerable attention.</span><sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-9' name='ref-footnote-9'>9</a></sup><span> This exchange at the beginning of the interactions between the two groups is summarized well by Jaimoukha:</span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>&quot;Archaeological finds show that there was a healthy cultural exchange between the Sarmatians and the North Caucasians. Caucasian-made objects were found in abundance in Sarmatian burial grounds. The Nakh seem to have been on the whole more advanced in their material culture than the Iranians, who were, among other things, not familiar with foundry work and the potter’s wheel. On the other hand, the Sarmatians, with their tribal kings and aristocracy, had superior social organization and military know-how (Ya.Z. Akhmadov 2002).&quot;</span></em><sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-10' name='ref-footnote-10'>10</a></sup></p></blockquote><p><span>This tradition of metallurgy was eventually inherited by the latest Iranian steppe tribes to inhabit the Northern Caucasus, the Alans:</span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>&quot;Many ancient Greek and Latin authors reported that among all the valiant peoples of the first centuries of CE, the Alans had the best military iron equipment. Tacitus wrote that the main power of the Alans was represented by their hard cavalry. It was recruited from the smart [nobility]. The Alanic rider wore the firm iron helmet and a coat of mail and used iron stirrups. His horse was also protected by an iron corslet. He was armed with the long spear tipped with an iron head and terribly long iron sword which could smash all the kinds of defense (Tacitus, Historiae, I, 79). Later, Arabic authors also described the wonderful Alanic sabers made of the highest quality steel.&quot;</span></em><sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-11' name='ref-footnote-11'>11</a></sup></p></blockquote><p><span>Metallurgy may have in fact been so important to the early Medieval Alans that some metallurgic themes have have almost certainly been preserved in the folklore of the Ossetians, a Caucasus people and partial-descendant of the Alans,</span><sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-12' name='ref-footnote-12'>12</a></sup><span> although probably not with the same kind of intentionality that some scholars might argue for.</span></p><p><span>Considering this quasi-religious importance of iron-working in the Caucasus, the influence that Caucasian metallurgy had on Scythian culture, as well as the fact that the Scythians certainly borrowed metallurgic, and possibly therefore theophoric, terminology from the ancestral Nakh language, it only makes sense to devote some more attention to Nakh culture. Fortunately, this task has already been attempted by I. M. Bulatbiev, whose essay assessing the Scythian sword cult from the angle of Nakh language and culture has been provided </span><a href='https://sapouidugnatos.github.io/skolota/akinakah/chechen-ars-eng.html'><span>here</span></a><span> in (admittedly Google-assisted) unofficial English translation for the first time.</span><sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-13' name='ref-footnote-13'>13</a></sup><span> Bulatbiev reconstructs and etymologizes the Chechen theonym, </span><em><span>Ars</span></em><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>&quot;As you know, first of all, the criterion for the emergence of the name of any object in ancient times was its essence. The names of the pagan gods were no exception: &quot;The name, according to the concepts of the ancients, contained the essence of the deity ...&quot; . The Chechen theonym Ars consists of two bases Ar + s  (/sa). The initial base Ar/ ascends the meaning ir (ir &lt; ar) ‘sharp, sharpness’. Its second part - /s (sa) - means ‘face, strip, angle’. Thus, the name of the theonym Ars in the Chechen language literally means Ar + s (ir + sa) ‘sharp + edge’, and the blade of a sword is essentially a sharp edge. Obviously, the etymology of the Chechen theonym Ars completely covers the definition of the power of a sword and a knife, to which the Chechen urs ‘knife’ naturally ascends.&quot;</span></em><sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-14' name='ref-footnote-14'>14</a></sup></p></blockquote><p><span>This etymology seems to reflect the Proto-Nakh root reconstructed by Starostin as </span><span>*</span><em><span>ʔurs</span></em><span>, the ablaut stem of which, </span><span>*</span><em><span>ʔarsV-</span></em><span>, is preserved in the Chechen plural formation </span><em><span>arsa-š</span></em><span>, according to Starostin.</span><sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-15' name='ref-footnote-15'>15</a></sup><span> This would probably yield a borrowed form of </span><span>*</span><span>*</span><em><span>arsah-</span></em><span> in Iranian, </span><span>*</span><span>*</span><em><span>Arsāh</span></em><span> in the nom.masc.sing. </span></p><p><span>Bulatbiev also discusses a few epithets associated with this theonym:</span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>&quot;The name of this cult also has an additional epithet Arsel - ela &#39;lord, god&#39; (literally, &quot;Ars the Sovereign&quot;), and this epithet ( ela ) undoubtedly denotes the status of theonym.&quot;</span></em><sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-16' name='ref-footnote-16'>16</a></sup></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em><span>&quot;Urus-Martan is a Russian transcription of the Chechen Urs-Mart ( urs &#39;knife&#39;), ascending to the original form Ars-Mart ( urs ← ars )... In Chechen, &#39;mart&#39; means &quot;grace, funeral feast, abundant food&quot; (in Batsbi - matr, with metathesis). The semantics of the word &#39;mart&#39; goes back to the original meaning &quot;ritually pure food, memorial meal&quot;. The concepts of &quot;ritually pure food&quot; and &quot;memorial meal&quot; have an exclusively religious connotation. Accordingly, the semantics of the word &#39;mart&#39;, presumably, also comes from the religious basis of the sacrifice rite. And in honor of the deity of war, as you know, sacrifices were made in large quantities.&quot;</span></em><sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-17' name='ref-footnote-17'>17</a></sup></p></blockquote><p><span>Bulatbiev also observes how this theonym may have been preserved in Chechen dance traditions:</span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>&quot;Speaking about the origin of the Chechen dance, the Chechen ethnographer AS Suleimanov writes: “Chechen warriors, in front of the enemy, stood in a wide circle and began to loudly exclaim &#39;Ars-wai! Ars-tokh!&#39; &lt;...&gt; and dancing, striking the shields with swords and daggers, they were rapidly approaching the enemy. Excited to the point of fury, they entered into a fierce battle with the enemy&quot;... The etymology of the exclamation &quot;Ars-tokh!&quot; literally means &quot;strike with Ars&quot; ( tokh &#39;beat, hit&#39;), &quot;Ars-vai!&quot; - &quot;Our Ars&quot; (vai &#39;our&#39;).&quot;</span></em><sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-18' name='ref-footnote-18'>18</a></sup></p></blockquote><p><span>Vestiges of sword worship among the various peoples of the Northeastern Caucasus can be even further elucidated by later Islamic descriptions of the peoples of the Eastern Caucasus. From Norris, quoting Abū Ḥāmid:</span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>&quot;Near to Derbend (Darbandā) is a lofty mountain at the foot of which there are two villages wherein reside a nation called the Zirī (yah) K(G)arān denoting the manufacturers of hauberks. They embrace in their craft all weapons of war, be they coats of chain mail, hauberks, helmets, swords, [spears], bows, daggers and other copper weapons of war. Their wives, their sons and their daughters and their slaves, both male and female, are engaged in these crafts and they do not till the land, nor do they tend gardens.&quot;</span></em><sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-19' name='ref-footnote-19'>19</a></sup></p></blockquote><p><span>There is also evidence to indicate that this sword veneration survived in the religious beliefs of these peoples of the North-Eastern Caucasus. According to Mizra Alexander Kazem-Beg, al-Qazwīnī (via Kazem-Beg), Teryukova, and Seferbekov, respectively:</span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>&quot;A similar tradition is preserved to this day among the inhabitants of Derbend and Daghistan; it announces that Muslimeh [spelt with a qammah, or as he is generally named in Caucasian stories, Abii Muslim], when returning to Syria, left his sword in a cave, to be a remembrance of the triumph of Islam in Daghistan etc, and that this sword was visible for many centuries, until, at last it disappeared. To this sword and cave they attributed many miracles, so much so, that the inhabitants of the country did not fail to bring their offerings thither and to solicit the mercy of God in time of need. The same tradition we find uncorrupted in Rauzetu-i- mitar from which Katibtchelebi has made a paraphrase in another place ... And in this country (Tabasaran / var. Tabarsalan) there is a cave, in which there is a sword. The inhabitants of this country, say, that it is the sword of Muslimeh (sic), who invaded the country by Muhammedan authority. The inhabitants of the country, during the Spring, bring great offerings and alms, and visit the sword as they do a sanctuary.&quot;</span></em><sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-20' name='ref-footnote-20'>20</a></sup></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em><span>&quot;In the suburbs of the town (Derbend) there is a hill upon which there is a mosque. On the Mihrab (shrine) of this mosque there is a sword, which, they say, belongs to Muslimeh (Abii Muslim!), the son of Abdul-Melik the son of Mervan and which is visited by crowds of people. Nobody can visit this (sword) but in white clothing; therefore if any go near it in coloured garments, there begin showers and storms, so that all that stands near the hill is in danger of perishing ...&quot;</span></em><sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-21' name='ref-footnote-21'>21</a></sup></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em><span>&quot;According to legends, Abu Muslim brought the residents of Chokh to Islam twelve times and twelve times the residents of Chokh went back to their faith. According to the legend written down in 1931, Sheikh Abu Muslim stuck his banner in a rock that he took over, on the spot where the best of the Chokh mosques would later be erected. On top of the banner, a swallow made a nest, and the victorious conqueror ordered to bring twelve small villages into a larger settlement. The residents of the nearby villages left their homes… They built their new houses around Sheikh’s banner out of stone, wood, and clay. According to the legend, the same happened in Ruguja, a village in Gunibsky District, 12 km to the west of Gunib. They, however, refused to convert to Islam and killed the missionary sent by Abu Muslim. Then, Abu Muslim ordered the residents of Chokh to send several people who were respected in the community to persuade the residents of Ruguja to convert into the new religion. The villagers of Chokh sent two of their respected citizens, but they, too, were killed. Then, the village of Chokh attacked Ruguja. As a result of the battle, the residents of Ruguja had to give up and convert to Islam. In gratitude and memory of these events, Abu Muslim granted the villagers of Chokh with the white banner with the copper topper and the sabre.&quot;</span></em><sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-22' name='ref-footnote-22'>22</a></sup></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em><span>&quot;&#39;In fact, there is a legend that leaving Dagestan, Sheikh Abumuslim threw his sword from the Jufu-Dag mountain. The sword fell on a hill in the sacred grove behind the village. For the sword, a house was built - &quot;Turdin khal&quot; (&quot;House of the sword&quot;) in the architectural style traditional for Tabasaran. The sword was kept in a sheath made of hemp threads (“the sword did not accept any other sheath”), in a special chest (“tavut”). To prevent the sword from rusting, it was smeared with fat tail fat. One could approach the sword only ritually clean and having performed namaz, in white clothes made of homespun woolen (&quot;shal&quot;) or hemp (&quot;ir&quot;) fabric. It is said that the sword often disappeared from the chest, entered into battle with the enemy, struck him, and then, covered in blood, reappeared in the chest.&#39;&quot;</span></em><sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-23' name='ref-footnote-23'>23</a></sup></p></blockquote><p><span>These probable survivals of Caucasian sword veneration in the Islamic era, are also occasionally accompanied by descriptions of probable rites of fertility. These rites have been described in Derbend:</span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>&quot;In Derbend, in March, blue, or sundry coloured clothes, are allowed, though only white should be worn at harvest time in the summer. Only this ensures that the rain will fall. Wearing a coloured dress will cause a drought and with it the total destruction of the fruit crop.&quot;</span></em><sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-24' name='ref-footnote-24'>24</a></sup></p></blockquote><p><span>Among the Tabasarans:</span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>&quot;&#39;&#39;...in one cave there is a sword, the inhabitants there say that this is the sword of Maslama, from among the Muslims who conquered this country. The people of this country in the spring bring into the cave all kindness and alms, cape to this sword and make a new scabbard. When they carry the scabbard into the cave, they take with them about a pound of wheat and, while walking, throw it on the ground until they put the sword in a new sheath, and then they return home....&#39;&quot;</span></em><sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-25' name='ref-footnote-25'>25</a></sup></p></blockquote><p><span>And in the rural locality of Chokh, according to the expedition notes of Evgenii Schilling:</span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>&quot;During the celebration of Uraz and Kurban, twice a year, the Kalani Mosque conducted the following procedure: the elder of the Abu-Muslim family took up the flag and the sabre. The mullahs supported him by his right and his left arm. The procession went out into the yard. The flag was put up and left to stand there for twenty-four hours. By the door of the lower door of the mosque, the elder of the Abu-Muslim family turns to face the neighbouring village of Rugudja and shakes his sabre. The crowd cheers the procession. The village elder throws old clay pots in the air, and the crowd tries to break them with stones before they fall on the ground. If the clay pots break, it is a sign of a good harvest for the following year. The sabre is taken back to the mosque. Threatening the village of Ruguja with the bare sabre is an evocation of the sword of Abu Muslim, who, according to the legend, had to conquer the unyielding Ruguja, where he was trying to establish Islam, a number of times...&quot;</span></em><sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-26' name='ref-footnote-26'>26</a></sup></p></blockquote><p><span>Several aspects of the Scythian sword cult may also survive in the Nart epics of the Ossetians, an Iranian-speaking people of the Caucasus and likely descendents of the Alans, a steppe Iranian people who likely continued the Scythian sword cult in their own religion.</span><sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-27' name='ref-footnote-27'>27</a></sup><span> One of the heroes of the Nart epic, a warrior named </span><em><span>Batraz</span></em><span>, has been associated with the Scythian &quot;Ares&quot; for a multitude of reasons. According to Raevskij:</span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>&quot;One of the main characters in the Ossetic Nartic epos is the brave but rather unbridled warrior Batraz, who acted many times as a protector of his compatriots from various enemies. He was made of hardened steel and was most closely bound to his sword: he was immortal until his sword was unbroken. This has led researchers to the logical conclusion that in the concrete case the sword was nothing but the incarnation of the hero himself. There is an opinion that both the Scythian Ares and the Ossetic Batraz were identical to the ancient Iranian war-god Vrtragna.</span></em></p><p><em><span>On the other hand, the quadrangular shape of the sacrificial altar of this Scythian deity, taken by itself, is directly related to the quadrilateral structure of space characterized above, whereas the sword thrust into the centre of this sacrificial altar was one of the incarnations of the world&#39;s axis which models the vertical structure of the Universe and links its three zones. In this way, the altar of the &#39;Scythian Ares&#39; is simply a model of the Universe, moreover predominantly of its middle zone - the air space. Apparently, the way in which sacrifices were offered to that deity - by throwing severed arms high into the air - was also connected with that function of the god.</span></em></p><p><em><span>The &#39;successor&#39; of the Scythian god - the Ossetic Batraz - also inhabited the air space and often acquired the image of the devastating whirlwind. And finally, we shall adduce here the evidence of the Greek author Lukianos, who was well familiar with the realia of Scythian culture and probably had first-hand knowledge of many motifs of Scythian folklore. In one of his works devoted to Scythian themes (Toxaris, 38) he reports that the Scythians worshipped the Wind and the Sword as gods. Indeed, these images seem to be opposed: the first one is a source of life, while the second one brings death. However, the very fact of their juxtaposing was hardly accidental. It suggests rather that this passage reflects a certain ambivalence of the unified Scythian image. What is more, researchers have drawn attention to the fact that the actual shaping of the tip and of the hilt of the ancient sword definitely resembles a phallus. Thus, this lethal weapon simultaneously acquires the form of a life-giving organ, which is an illustration of the discussed ambivalence.&quot;</span></em><sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-28' name='ref-footnote-28'>28</a></sup><span> </span></p></blockquote><p><span>Of particular interest here is the upright sword acting as the </span><em><span>axis mundi in effigy.</span></em><span> This liminal role may be reflected in the cult of the &#39;sword god&#39; from Chamber B of the Hittite religious complex at Yazılıkaya. A stone-cut sanctuary, the complex&#39;s chambers which were certainly originally the site of cthonic cult also were modified to be open to the sky, implying an additional aspect of celestiality.</span><sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-29' name='ref-footnote-29'>29</a></sup><span> The sword god, as a stand-in for the world axis, bridged the divide between those two realms as well as the middle realm of mankind. Given the Scythians&#39; known interactions with and conquests in the Near East, a Near Eastern influence on some aspects of the Scythian religion cannot be discounted. Note also the possible practice of Nabatean stonemasons to portray their patron deity in a xiphomorphic fashion.</span><sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-30' name='ref-footnote-30'>30</a></sup></p><p><span>The connection between Batraz and the Scythian &quot;Ares&quot; is elaborated in even further detail by Abaev:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>	</span><em><span>&quot;The connection between Batraz and the heathen cults of the Scythians and the ancient Aryans is supported by several direct parallels drawn by Dumézil.8 The ceremony of casting Batraz’s sword into the sea compares with the cult of the sword among the Scythians and Alans. The bonfire of “a hundred wagonloads of coal,” into which Batraz strides to become tempered before the trembling Narts, recalls the grandiose annual construction of a fire of “a hundred and fifty cartloads of logs,” which served the Scythians as a pedestal for their sword god, around which were slaughtered their trembling war captives.</span></em></p><p><span>	</span><em><span>In one tale recorded by Dzhantemir Shanaev, Batraz’s sword itself acts as a thunder-god. “The story,” says Shanaev, “asserts that Batraz’s sword was cast into the Black Sea.” He adds that “when the lightning flashes from the west Ossetians regard it as the gleam of Batraz’s sword, hurling itself out of the sea against the heavens to destroy evil powers and devils” (from Shanaev 1871).</span></em></p><p><span>	</span><em><span>Beside the array of traits characterizing Batraz as a mythical symbol of a thunder-god, there still remain in his cycle many motifs that in their turn have wide parallels in world folklore. The clear parallel from Scythian customs, to which Miller (1881–87) has drawn our attention, has great importance for the explanation of the motif of the miraculous cup Watsamonga in the Nart epic. This cup raised itself to the lips of real heroes, telling of their campaigns, but remained motionless before braggarts and the boastful.</span></em></p><p><span>	</span><em><span>Here is what Herodotus tells us about the Scythians: &#39;Once a year each regional chief at the festival ordered a glass of wine mixed with water, and all the Scythians who had killed an enemy drank from this goblet. Only those who had not performed this service had not the right to touch it. They sat aside in a state of shame that was for them a great dishonor. As for those who killed a large number of foes, they drank from two goblets united together.&#39;</span></em></p><p><span>		</span><em><span>Aristotle also mentions this in his Politics: &#39;The Scythians at one of their festivals do not allow those who had not killed one single enemy to partake of the cup going round.&#39;</span></em></p><p><span>	</span><em><span>The closeness of the Tales of the Narts and the stories of Herodotus are striking. Both among the Narts and the Scythians the wine-cup served as an honorary reward for feats of battle, and to “distinguish real heroes.” In connection with this Dumézil notes the role that the goblet plays in Scythian mythology.9 Four things, all made of gold, which according to Scythian belief fell from heaven, were the plow, the yoke, the axe, and the goblet. It is also well-known what role holy wine and goblets played in Indo-Iranian cults.</span></em></p><p><span>	</span><em><span>One of the central episodes of the Batraz cycle is where Batraz takes blood-revenge for his father’s death. The classical motif of patriarchal-tribal custom, the blood-feud, occupied a leading place in the Nart epic not by chance alone. Speaking earlier about the specially lively aspects of this epic, we showed that one of the reasons for this fidelity to life must be seen in the way that the social conditions that gave birth to this epic continued to exist for a long time, and to further nourish it, thus saving it from ossification, degradation, and oblivion. The blood-feud motif entered the epic under the conditions of a patriarchal-tribal relationship and, judging by other elements of the Batraz cycle, at extremely distant times. But those patriarchal-tribal relations, including the blood-feud, continued to exist and flourish in Ossetian customs through many centuries. This is the reason why the story of how Batraz took revenge for the death of his father was, and remained, one of the favorite and most popular episodes of the epic. Here is the reason why a whole series of Nart heroes besides Batraz also appear as avengers of their father’s blood: Totraz, son of Albeg; Atsamazh,10 son of Atsa; Kaitar and Bitar, sons of Shoshlan. It is not by chance that the well-known folk epic, named &#39;Avkhardti Khasanah&#39; among Ossetians, also has blood-revenge as its theme.</span></em></p><p><span>	</span><em><span>The severe, persistent, and pitiless manner in which Batraz fulfills his filial duty as blood-avenger might appear repulsive to the modern reader, but one must take into account the fact that this epic was composed in very cruel times with very cruel and severe customs. Batraz’s actions are dictated not by mere caprice, but by the idea of duty. His revenge is the victory of justice, as it was understood in tribal conditions. It contains fewer arbitrary elements and less unjustifiable cruelty than, say, the revenge of Krumhilda in &#39;The Song of the Niebelungen.&#39; Moreover, in it are found individual features of knightly nobility and magnanimity. Thus, when Batraz brings the hewn-off arm of the slain Lord Shainag to Shatana as a war-trophy, she then suggests that he should return it to his relatives so that they may make an interment with due honors, which without the missing arm would be impossible according to their customs. Batraz does so without one word of protest.</span></em></p><p><span>	</span><em><span>Does not the cutting off of Lord Shainag’s right arm contain the echo of an ancient custom? Herodotus (book 4) cites: &#39;The Scythians bring to their war-god sacrifices not only of beasts, but of human beings. Human sacrifice is carried out in this way: from the number of prisoners they chose each hundredth one, and cut off his right shoulder including the arm. The hewn-off limb is then hurled in the air, and left to rest wherever it falls, the body being left in another place.&#39; This hacking off of the right arm appeared evidently among the Scythians, and among Ossetians, as a symbol of shameful dishonor for the enemy, depriving him of the right for honorable burial. The Ossetians’ near-neighbors from Georgia, the Khevsur mountain-tribe, had a custom of cutting off the right hand of the defeated enemy as a war-trophy. The number of hands hanging on the wall served as a measure of the prowess of the Khevsur warriors.</span></em></p><p><span>	</span><em><span>Numerous parallels between the Batraz cycle and Scythian-Alan realities, as well as ancient customs, give us the right to assert that this cycle is quite original, and extremely old. On the other hand, however, there can be but little doubt that the names ‘Khamis’ and ‘Batraz’ are Mongolian in character, and taken with other facts show that the Alan epic came under the influence of the Mongols (but see English-language editor’s note 5). There are doubts as to whether that influence was limited to personal names. Subjects and motifs may have also been borrowed. This question of Mongolian-Turkish elements in the Tales of the Narts deserves a good deal more work and attention.</span></em></p><p><span>	</span><em><span>The analysis of the themes and subjects of the Batraz cycle lead one to the conclusion that it was a long time in its formative period. Its most ancient elements derive from ancient history. It brings to us through the centuries the motifs of Scytho-Alan existence, and of Iranian mythology. The presence of Mongolian influence can only be dated to around the thirteenth to fourteenth centuries. Between these two extremes we see not only the development of the Batraz cycle but also of the Nart epic as a whole.&quot;</span></em><sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-31' name='ref-footnote-31'>31</a></sup></p></blockquote><p><span>Despite Abaev&#39;s assertion above of a Mongolian origin for the name </span><em><span>Batraz</span></em><span> (probably from </span><em><span>batyr</span></em><span> &lt; Türkic </span><em><span>baɣatur</span></em><span> &#39;hero&#39;(?), which may be of Indo-European provenance anyway, possibly from the Sanskrit adjective </span><em><span>mahā</span></em><span> &#39;great&#39;,</span><sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-32' name='ref-footnote-32'>32</a></sup><span> or ultimately from an Indo-European root for &#39;god&#39;</span><sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-33' name='ref-footnote-33'>33</a></sup><span> (the ancestor of Iranian </span><em><span>baga-</span></em><sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-34' name='ref-footnote-34'>34</a></sup><span>), affixed with either an aggentive suffix or the intensifying particle </span><em><span>-tara</span></em><span>), </span><em><span>Batraz</span></em><span> may also ultimately be of Caucasian origin, considering another likely etymology of His name.

Thieme, “The &quot;Aryan&quot; Gods of the Mitanni Treaties,” JAOS 80, 1960, pp. 312-14). His Avestan epithets are: amavant- “strong, endowed with attacking might,” ahuraδāta- “created by Ahura,” barō.xᵛarəna- “bearing xᵛarənah-,” hvāxšta- “possessing good peace,” hvāyaona- “possessing a good place,” aršō.kara- “conferring virility,” maršō.kara- “rendering decrepit,” frašō.kara- “making wonderful.” The epithets hvāxšta- and hvāyaona- associate him with Čistā (É.Benveniste and L. Renou, Vṛtra et Vṛθragna. Ētude de mythologie indo-iranienne, Paris, 1934, pp. 58ff.) while aršō.kara-, maršō.kara-, and frašō.kara- relate him to Zurwān (H. S. Nyberg, “Questions de cosmogonie et de cosmologie mazdéennes,” JA 219, 1931, pp. 86ff.).</span></em></p><p><span>	</span><em><span>In the Avesta, Vərəθraγna has all the characteristics of an ancient warrior god, the personification of a force that shatters and overcomes any resistance or defense, an irresistible offensive force which displays its strength in attack. For this reason he is associated with Vanaintī Uparatāt “Conquering Superiority” (Yt. 14.0, 64) and is venerated as yazatanąm zayō.tə̄mō “the most highly armed of the gods” (Yt. 14.1), amavastəmō “the most endowed with attacking might” (Yt. 14.3), xᵛarənaŋuhastəmō “the most endowed with xᵛarənah-” (Yt. 14.3). He is represented as being in constant battle against his enemies, men and demons (daēvas), wizards (yātus) and pairikās, kavis and karapans (Yt. 14.4, 62).</span></em></p><p><span>	</span><em><span>Bahrām yašt (Yt. 14), dedicated to Vərəθraγna, belongs to the most ancient sections of the Younger Avesta or, at least, contains many archaic elements (A. Christensen, Études sur le zoroastrisme de la Perse antique, Copenhagen, 1928, pp. 7-8; M. Boyce, Zoroastrianism I, p. 63). Bahrām yašt is not one of the better preserved yašts, yet it gives us a vivid and exhaustive picture of the divinity. It first enumerates the ten incarnations, in both animal and human form, of Vərəθraγna. These recall, although exact correspondences are lacking, the avatāras of Viṣṇu in Purāṇic literature, or the ten incarnations of Indra (J. Charpentier, Kleine Beiträge zur indoiranischen Mythologie, Uppsala, 1911, pp. 25-68): an impetuous wind (Yt. 14.2-5); a bull with horns of gold (v. 7); a white horse with ears and muzzle of gold (v. 9); a camel in heat (vv. 11-13); a boar (v. 15); a youth at the ideal age of fifteen (v. 17); a falcon or bird of prey, vārəγna- (vv. 19-21); a ram (v. 23); a wild goat (v. 25); and an armed warrior (v. 27). It is interesting to note that the Avesta also attributed some of these metamorphoses to Tištrya (Yt. 8.13, 16, 20): the youth of fifteen, the bull with the horns of gold and the white horse; to Xᵛarənah (Yt. 19.35): the bird vārəγna-, and to Vayu: the camel (Dēnkard, ed. Sanjana, IX, 23.2-3; Benveniste and Renou, pp. 35f.). The first metamorphosis, the impetuous wind, also links the god of victory to Vāta (Vayu), another divinity endowed with warlike virtues in Iranian mythology (H. S. Nyberg, Die Religionen des alten Iran, Leipzig, 1938, p. 75; S. Wikander, Vayu I, Lund, 1942; G. Widengren, Les religions de l’Iran, Paris, 1968, pp. 33ff.).</span></em></p><p><span>	</span><em><span>After the description of the incarnations of the god, the Bahrām yašt goes on to list the favors and gifts bestowed by Vərəθraγna on Zaraθuštra and on those who worship him according to the cult. These gifts are victory in thought, in word, and in action, as well as in declamatory speech and in retort, in conformity with a conception dating back to the Indo-Iranian practice of verbal contest (F. B. J. Kuiper, “The Ancient Aryan Verbal Contest,” IIJ 4,1960, pp. 243, 246). This evident Zoroastrianization of the cult of Vərəθraγna, which is reflected in Yt. 14.28-33, is coupled with a more popular image of the god, one in which he is more closely linked to magical elements and practices of exorcism which find parallels in India (B. Geiger, Die Aməša Spəntas. Ihr Wesen und ihre ursprüngliche Bedeutung, Vienna, 1916, pp. 66ff.; H. Lommel, Die Yäšt’s des Awesta, Göttingen, 1927, pp. 134-35; Benveniste and Renou, pp. 30-31). These were principally a matter of the so-called “magic of the feather,” i.e., oracles based on the falling or flying of a falcon’s feather, and so on (vv. 34-46). The rest of the yašt (vv. 47-64) is a hymn of praise to the god. The power of the god and the strength which this transmits to the Airyas are such as to confound all their enemies. On the other hand, the Vyāmburas (an unknown people), whom the Bahrām yašt describes as those who shed blood, burn prohibited wood, and make forbidden animal sacrifices (see Benveniste and Renou, pp. 37-38) follow other ritual practices in the cult of the god, which the faithful worshipers of Mazdā must stay away from (vv. 54-56).</span></em><span>..</span></p><p><span>	</span><em><span>...Our knowledge of Vərəθraγna indicates that the god’s functions were not limited to war and physical or military victory. He has other epithets and other characteristics which make him a more complex figure, one connected also with virility and sexual potency as well as health and physical integrity. He is defined as the one who gives man the “spring of the testicles,” ərəzōiš xå ( Yt. 14.29) and as the one who is baēšazyō.təmō, “the most gifted with healing” or healing powers (Yt. 14.3). In modern times, Bahrām is particularly worshipped as a divinity protecting those who undertake journeys (Boyce, Zoroastrianism I, p. 62 and n. 267). In fact, the Zoroastrian reform must have had a great influence on the evolution of this divine figure. This can also be inferred from the roles of Warahrān and Bahrām in later religious writings, from the Pahlavi texts of the ninth century to those of Parsism (see below). The principal evolution of Vərəθraγna in Zoroastrianism is without doubt to his role as the god of victory over the forces of evil in an intellectual and moral sense. The evolution of Vərəθraγna/Warahrān/Bahrām can not be understood outside the context of a radical revolution in traditional ethical and religious values. This has been pointed out by G. Dumézil, among others, (Heur et malheur du guerrier, Paris, 19852, pp. 179ff.).</span></em><span>&quot;</span><sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-38' name='ref-footnote-38'>38</a></sup></p></blockquote><p><span>One other possible mythological connection must also be addressed:</span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>&quot;...it is possible that the Scythian Ares was mighty Indra, who for Zoroastrians was the chief of the warlike, amoral Daevas, and a very fitting deity to receive worship from the freebooting Scythians.&quot;</span></em><sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-39' name='ref-footnote-39'>39</a></sup></p></blockquote><p><span>However, this connection may not necessarily be as straightforward as Boyce would have us believe, as Indra&#39;s role within Iranian mythology is not quite firm:</span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>&quot;Turning to the Iranian traditions, preserved chiefly in the Avesta, but also in the Pahlavi books and the Šāh-nāma, we find no trace of a myth involving Indra, or any other deity, with a snake named Wṛθra. In the context of its preoccupation with dynastic succession, the Iranian tradition presents two pairs of characters, Θrita (Ved. Trita), whose son Kərəsāspa slew the monstrous Horned Snake, and Āθβya (cf. Ved. Āptya), whose son Θraētaona (Pahl. Frēdōn, NPers. Feridun) slew the three-headed usurper, Aži Dahāka (MPers. Aždahāg, Šāh-nāma Ḏaḥḥāk; NPers aždahā “dragon”). The evidence shows that the oldest stratum of associated snake-slaying myths is represented by the complex involving Θrita / Āθβya / Θraētaona / Kərəsāspa on the Iranian side and Trita Āptya on the Indo-Aryan. Abundantly attested in the Avesta is the abstract noun wərəθra- n. “resistance, defense, obstruction” along with derivative compounds: wərəθraγna- n. “the smashing of resistance; victory,” masc. name of a god; wərəθrajan- (Ved. vṛtrahán-) adj. “smashing of resistance; victorious;” wərəθra.taurwan-, °wan(t)- adj. “defeating resistance.” This leaves the myth of Indra and Vṛtra as a Vedic innovation created out of the older myths and concepts. Further, Vedic Indra shares martial attributes with two closely related Iranian deities. One is Wərəθraγna who is the embodiment of the concept acted out in Vedic Indra’s mythic struggle with Vṛtra, and, who shares with Vedic Indra the ability of change form. The other is Miθra. The descriptions of his violent enforcement of covenants, especially with his bronze mace (wazra-), closely resemble those of Indra in the Ṛgveda, while in the Veda Mitra is remarkably devoid of martial qualities. In the attempt to reconstruct Indra’s history within the two Indo-Iranian branches one might suppose that he was demonized in Iran because, after Zaraθuštra’s reform, the violent traits of his character were deemed offensive, being worthy only of a daēwa. However, that hardly explains why those very traits would have been simply parceled out to other “ahuric” deities. Alternatively, and more probably, one could imagine Indra as a relatively minor deity who, in his ascent among the Indo-Aryans, gradually appropriated traits from other deities at their expense. Impossible to substantiate is the notion that Iranians, in cultural conflict with Indo-Aryans, demonized their chief god. Wherever the truth in these matters lies, one should bear in mind that the universe of mythic imagination is not usually laid out in clear, straight lines. One further tangle in the web of associations is Iranian Indra’s close connection to two other demonized gods, Saurwa = Ved. Śarva and Nåŋhaiθya = the dual Nāsatyā. In the Vedic literature, Śarva is a somewhat sinister figure in the sphere of Rudra, while the Nāsatyā (identified with the Ašvinā) are benevolent and among the most frequently invoked deities.&quot;</span></em><sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-40' name='ref-footnote-40'>40</a></sup></p></blockquote><p><span>From these associations, a relatively clear picture of </span><em><span>Akīnakāh</span></em><span> comes into focus. His figure is one of duality and contradiction. He is both &#39;the most gifted with healing&#39; and the means of bodily harm. He is both the patron of male virility, a giver of life, and lord of the afterlife, a bringer of death. He is birth and death. The Beginning and the End. This mythological narrative is simply begging to be ritually reenacted yearly in the ritual cycle of a revived Scythian religious practice. The annual erection of the wooden altar into which the sacred </span><em><span>akīnakah</span></em><span> is driven, the festival for which must have occured in the Spring, judging from Herodotus&#39; comment that it must be partially rebuilt every year &quot;for the storms of winter always make it sink down&quot;, represents </span><em><span>Akīnakāh</span></em><span>&#39;s birth and tempering as reflected in the myth of </span><em><span>Batraz</span></em><span> being tempered in the coals and is associated with rites of fertility. To echo the original rite, ungulate-shaped bread should be offered and the right arm should be severed from a straw dummy and cast into the air. Sacred wine may also be offered, and wine may be traditionally consumed. Grain may also be scattered and the scabbard may be replaced. From this time until Winter, the sacred sword may only be approached in undyed clothing. In the Winter, </span><em><span>Akīnakāh</span></em><span>&#39;s death may be symbolically represented by ritually destroying a (preferably biodegradable alternative to a) sword, and then casting it into a body of water, reflected by the myth of </span><em><span>Batraz</span></em><span>&#39; sword being cast into the Black Sea, marking </span><em><span>Akīnakāh</span></em><span>&#39;s transition to ruler of the afterlife.  </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span>Bibliography</span></strong></p><hr /><p><strong><span>1</span></strong><span> Atwood, C.
